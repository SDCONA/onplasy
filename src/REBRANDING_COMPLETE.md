# ✅ Rebranding Complete: OnPlasy

## Brand Update Summary

Your marketplace has been successfully rebranded from "Marketpla$y" to **"OnPlasy"**.

### Domain Information
- **New Domain**: Onplasy
- **Full Brand Name**: Sell OnPlasy

### Updated Locations

#### 1. **Main Branding** ✅
- **Header Component** (`/components/Header.tsx`)
  - Logo displays: "On" (green, bold) + "Plasy" (blue)
  - Clean, simple styling across all pages

#### 2. **User-Facing Content** ✅
- **Auth Page** (`/pages/AuthPage.tsx`)
  - Login title: "Login to OnPlasy"

#### 3. **Documentation Files** ✅
Updated all documentation headers:
- `/README_SETUP.md`
- `/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`
- `/MARKETPLACE_GUIDE.md`
- `/QUICK_START.md`
- `/FEATURES_SUMMARY.md`

### Brand Styling

The new brand name is styled with two distinct colors:
- **"On"** - Green text, bold (`text-green-600 font-bold`)
- **"Plasy"** - Blue text (`text-blue-600`)

This creates a clean, cohesive brand identity with the green "On" as the emphasis element.

### What Remains Unchanged

The following generic terms were intentionally left as-is since they don't contain the old brand name:
- "marketplace" references in documentation (describing the platform type)
- Generic terms like "platform", "application", "service"
- Database schema comments and technical documentation

### Next Steps

Your marketplace is now fully branded as **OnPlasy** and ready to use with your Onplasy domain! 🎉

All user-facing elements display the new brand consistently.
